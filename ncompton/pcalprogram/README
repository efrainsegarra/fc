This program takes a root file of events as input and based on strip numbers
and ADC readouts, the distance from the PMT is calaculated along with attenuation
coefficients, Gains, and fit parameters.

All output is recorded in the directory outputfiles.

The input requires a root file, pedestal values, hitmatrix.txt.

In the development stages these were hard coded in and compiled via:
g++ -oRaw Rawhistos.c `root-config --cflags --glibs`

However, this did not allow an easy way to calibrate separate sectors or
use different files without editing the program. Therefore to compile
and run this program follow the steps below.


1. Verify that the file hitmatrix.txt is in the inputfiles directory.

2. Type make
    If make does not work you could try 
    g++ -oRawhistos Rawhistos.c `root-config --cflags --glibs`
    
3. Type "./Rawhistos <SectorNumber> <SectorRootFile> <PMTpedestal>"
        <SectorNumber> is of int type
        <SectorRootFile> is a file name
        <PMTpedestal> is a file name

4. This program may take 5-10 minutes to run depending on the machine it
is compiled and run on.

5. Once it is finished the Attenuation coefficients, Gains, Gaussian fit
parameters, and 4 root files (containing each iteration of fits and
set-up) will be in the outputfiles directory.

Please note that if you recieve the error:
"Error in ROOT::Math::ParameterSettings>: Invalid lower/upper bounds - ignoring the bounds"
the program is still working, and therefore you should not be alarmed.
