\section{Fit ADC Output}
A trapezoidal bin can be formed by the overlap of the u and w strips.
Each one of these trapezoids should have a simialar adc readout value. 
Statistically one would expect a gaussian distribution of values. 
The centroid of this distribution is used as a data point at that center of that w bin.
